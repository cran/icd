#' ICD-9 codes they describe. Helpful in summarizing codes or grouping for
#' human-readable output. These can easily be converted to a co-morbidity

#' ICD-10-CM
#'
#' The public domain modified ICD-10 classification as published in the public
#' domain by the US CDC. Currently this has a slightly different structure to
#' \code{icd9cm_hierarchy} because the published data helpfully has a
#' \emph{leaf} flag indicating whether a code is a \emph{billable} leaf node, or
#' a code higher in the hierarchy which nevertheless will have a description.
#'
#' There are annual revisions to this data. Currently, the 2016 edition is
#' included.

#' Quan adaptation of Deyo/Charlson comorbidities
#'
#' Derived automatically from the SAS code used in the original publication.
#' According to the referenced study, this provides the best predictor of
#' in-patient to <30d mortality. Of note, Deyo drops the distinction between
#' leukemia, lymphoma and non-metastatic cancer. As far as I have looked into
#' this, in the rare cases where someone had two or three of leukemia, lymphoma
#' and non-metastatic cancer, the Quan adaptation would give a lower Charlson
#' score than the original scheme. The Deyo original Charlson to ICD-9-CM groups
#' does include distinct categories for these things.

#' Elixhauser comorbidities
#'
#' The original mapping of Elixhauser's ICD-9-CM to 30 comorbidities. According

#'
#' These lists provide correctly sorted names of the comorbidities and their

#'
#' In the Elixhauser derived mappings, uncomplicated and complicated
#' hypertension are listed separately, but are always combined in the final
#' analyses. Uncomplicated and complicated hypertension are list separately and
#' as "Hypertension, combined." _abbrev suffix indicates a very short space-free
#' description. Quan's version of Elixhauser is identical. AHRQ updates drops
#' the arrythmia field. The naming convention is a root, e.g.
#' \code{elixComorbid}, with neither/either/both suffixes \code{_htn} and
#' \code{_abbrev}. The Charlson derived mappings do not include hypertension.
#' _abbreviated comorbidity names are helpful for interactive work, whereas the
#' full names might be preferred for plotting.
