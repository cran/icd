### AHRQ comorbidity classification

The AHRQ keeps an updated version of the Elixhauser classification of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes into comorbidities. They provide the data in the form of SAS code. The names of the comorbidities derived from ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes are the same. Maps contain the ICD code to comorbidity mappings; the functions that apply those mappings are called things like `icd10_comorbid_ahrq`.
```{r ahrq}
#icd9_map_ahrq <- icd:::sas_parse_ahrq() # user doesn't need to do this
names(icd9_map_ahrq)
icd9_map_ahrq$CHF[1:5]
icd10_map_ahrq$CHF[1:5]
```

### Quan
Quan's paper looked at indices using both ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM. Quan generated updated ICD-9-CM codes for all 30 of Elixhauser and all 17 of Charlson/Deyo's comorbidities. Thus there are two 'Quan' comorbidity mappings.
```{r quan elix}
names(icd10_map_quan_deyo)
names(icd10_map_quan_elix)
```
