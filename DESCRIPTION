Description: Calculate comorbidities, Charlson and van Walraven
    scores, perform fast and accurate validation, conversion,
    manipulation, filtering and comparison of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. This
    package enables a work flow from raw lists of ICD codes in hospital
    databases to comorbidities.  ICD-9 and ICD-10 comorbidity mappings
    from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ
    included.  Common ambiguities and code formats are handled.
