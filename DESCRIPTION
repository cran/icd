Description: Calculate comorbidities, Charlson scores, perform
    fast and accurate validation, conversion, manipulation, filtering and
    comparison of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. This package enables a work flow
    from raw lists of ICD codes in hospital databases to
    comorbidities. ICD-9 and ICD-10 comorbidity mappings from Quan (Deyo
    and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included.  Common
    ambiguities and code formats are handled.
