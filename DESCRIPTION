Description: Calculate comorbidities, medical risk scores, and
    work very quickly and precisely with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. This
    package enables a work flow from raw tables of ICD codes in hospital
    databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 and ICD-10 comorbidity mappings from
    Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included.
    Common ambiguities and code formats are handled. Comorbidity
    computation includes Hierarchical Condition Codes, and an
    implementation of AHRQ Clinical Classifications. Risk
    scores include those of Charlson and van Walraven.  US Clinical
    Modification, Word Health Organization, Belgian and French ICD-10
    codes are supported, most of which are downloaded on demand.
