  long descriptions.}

\description{
The public domain modified ICD-10 classification as published in the public
domain by the US CDC. Currently this has a slightly different structure to
\code{icd9cm_hierarchy} because the published data helpfully has a
\emph{leaf} flag indicating whether a code is a \emph{billable} leaf node, or
a code higher in the hierarchy which nevertheless will have a description.
}
\details{
There are annual revisions to this data. Currently, the 2016 edition is
included.
