\title{condense \code{icd_explain_table} output down to major codes}
\usage{
condense_explain_table(x)
}
\description{
if a major code appears in the code column, and any children of that major
code, the children are aggregated to a list and added to the major code row.
This does currently not 'condense' e.g. middle-order codes
}
\details{
Unlike \code{icd_explain_table}, preserving order doesn't make sense, since
rows anywhere in the list can be aggregated, thus altering order compared to
the input. Size of the output will also be different if any condensing was
done.
