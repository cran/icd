\description{
This is not quite a super-set of ICD-10 sub-chapters: many more codes than
ICD-10, but some are abbreviated, notably HIV.
}
\details{
This is complicated by the XML document specifying more hierarchical
levels,e.g. \code{C00-C96}, \code{C00-75} are both specified within the
chapter Neoplasms (\code{C00-D49}). A way of determining whether there are
extra levels would be to check the XML tree depth for a member of each
putative sub-chapter.
