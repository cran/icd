\title{Decompose a 'short' ICD code and insert the leading zeroes as needed.}
\usage{
icd9AddLeadingZeroesShortSingle(x)
}
\description{
This should add leading zeroes when there is definitely no ambiguity,
e.g. V1. However V10 should not be altered, because V010 is a different
code. The goal is for this to be faster, but must be correct! Example in
\code{manip.cpp} has the benchmark code.
