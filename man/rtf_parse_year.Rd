}
\usage{
rtf_parse_year(year = "2011", ..., save_data = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE, offline = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{from 1996 to 2012 (this is what CDC has published). Only 2012
implemented thus far}

\description{
Currently only the most recent update is implemented. Note that CMS have
published additional ICD-9-CM billable code lists since the last one from the
CDC: I think these have been the same every year since 2011, though. The last
CDC release is \code{Dtab12.rtf} from 2011.

\details{
The file itself is 7 bit ASCII, but has its own internal encoding using
'CP1252.' Test 'Meniere's' disease with lines 24821 to 24822 from 2012 RTF
