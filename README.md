Comorbidities from ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, manipulation and validation
======================================================================

Features
--------

-   find comorbidities of patients based on admission or discharge ICD-9
    or ICD-10 codes, e.g. Cancer, Heart Disease
    -   several standard mappings of ICD codes to comorbidities are
        included (Quan, Deyo, Elixhauser, AHRQ, PCCC)
    -   very fast assignment of ICD codes to comorbidities (using matrix
        multiplication with C and C++ internally)
-   summarizing groups of ICD codes in natural language
-   Charlson and Van Walraven score calculations
-   Hierarchical Condition Codes (HCC) from CMS
-   Clinical Classifcations Software (CCS) comorbidities from AHRQ
-   Pediatric Complex Chronic Condition comorbidities
-   AHRQ ICD-10 procedure code classification
-   validation of ICD codes from different annual revisions of ICD-9-CM
    and ICD-10-CM
-   correct conversion between different representations of ICD codes,
    with and without a decimal points, leading and trailing characters
    (this is not trivial for ICD-9-CM). ICD-9 to ICD-10 cross-walk is
    not yet implemented
-   comprehensive test suite to increase confidence in accurate
    processing of ICD codes
-   all internal ICD and comorbidity data is extracted directly from
    publically available data or code, increasing confidence in the
    results

Install
-------

``` r
install.packages("icd")
```

Introduction
------------

Calculate comorbidities, Charlson and van Walraven scores, perform fast
and accurate validation, conversion, manipulation, filtering and
comparison of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. This package enables a work flow
from raw lists of ICD codes in hospital databases to comorbidities.
ICD-9 and ICD-10 comorbidity mappings from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser
versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included. Common ambiguities and code
formats are handled.

Relevance
---------

ICD-9 codes are still in heavy use around the world, particularly in the
USA where the ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) was in widespread use
until the end of 2015. ICD-10 has been used worldwide for reporting
cause of death for more than a decade, and ICD-11 is due to be released
in 2018. ICD-10-CM is now the primary coding scheme for US hospital
admission and discharge diagnoses used for regulatory purposes and
billing. A vast amount of electronic patient data is recorded with ICD-9
codes of some kind: this package enables their use in R alongside
ICD-10.

Comorbidities
-------------

A common requirement for medical research involving patients is
determining new or existing comorbidities. This is often reported in
*Table 1* of research papers to demonstrate the similarity or
differences of groups of patients. This package is focussed on fast and
accurate generation of this comorbidity information from raw lists of
ICD-9 codes.

ICD-9 codes
-----------

ICD-9 codes are not numbers, and great care is needed when matching
individual codes and ranges of codes. It is easy to make mistakes, hence
the need for this package. ICD-9 codes can be presented in *short* 5
character format, or *decimal* format, with a decimal place separating
the code into two groups. There are also codes beginning with V and E
which have different validation rules. Zeroes after a decimal place are
meaningful, so numeric ICD-9 codes cannot be used in most cases. In
addition, most clinical databases contain invalid codes, and even
decimal and non-decimal format codes in different places. This package
primarily deals with ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) codes, but should
be applicable or easily extendible to the original WHO ICD-9 system.

ICD-10 codes
------------

ICD-10 has a somewhat simpler format, with consistent use of a letter,
then two alphanumeric characters. However, especially for ICD-10-CM,
there are a multitude of qualifiers, e.g. specifying recurrence,
laterality, which vastly increase the number of possible codes. This
package recognizes validity of codes by syntax alone, or whether the
codes appear in a canonical list. The current ICD-10-CM master list is
the 2016 set. There is no capability of converting between ICD-9 and
ICD-10, but comorbidities can be generated from older ICD-9 codes and
newer ICD-10 codes in parallel, and the comorbidities can then be
compared.

Examples
--------

See also the vignettes and examples embedded in the help for each
function for more. Here’s a taste:

``` r

#> 1     1000 40201    Y
#> 2     1000  2258 <NA>

#> 6     1001  4011    Y
#> 7     1002  4011    E

```

Look at the help files for details and examples of almost every function
in this package.

``` r
?comorbid
?comorbid_hcc
?explain_code
?is_valid
```

Note that reformatting from wide to long and back is not as
straightforward as using the various Hadley Wickham tools for doing
this: knowing the more detailed structure of the data let’s us do this
better for the case of dealing with ICD codes.

Advanced
--------

### Source Data and SAS format files

In the spirit of reproducible research, all the R data files in this
package can be recreated from source. The size of the source files makes
it cumbersome to include them in the R package available on CRAN. Using
the github source, you can pull the original data and SAS format files,
and rebuild the data; or use the tools provided by this package to
update the data using new source data files, e.g. when ICD-10-CM 2017 is
released.

### Development version

The latest version is available in [github
icd](https://github.com/jackwasey/icd), and can be installed with:

``` r
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("jackwasey/icd")
```

The *master* branch at github should always build and pass all tests and
R CMD check, and will be similar or identical to the most recent CRAN
release. The CRAN releases are stable milestones. Contributions and bug
reports are encouraged and essential for this package to remain current
and useful to the many people who have installed it.

### Contributing and Building

A substantial amount of code has now been contributed to the package.
Contributions of any kind to `icd` are very welcome. See the \[GitHub
issues page\]\](<https://github.com/jackwasey/icd/issues>) to see jobs
and feature requests. Documentation, vignettes and examples are very
welcome, especially if accompanied by some real-world data.

To build `icd`, `Rcpp` must be compiled from source. This happens
automatically on Linux, but on Mac and Windows, the following may be
required: `install.packages("Rcpp", type="source")`
