@article{charlson_new_1987,
  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: ``0'', 12\% (181); ``1\textendash{}2'', 26\% (225); ``3\textendash{}4'', 52\% (71); and ``$\geqslant$ 5'', 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: ``0'', 8\% (588); ``1'', 25\% (54); ``2'', 48\% (25); `` $\geqslant$ 3'', 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank $\chi$2 = 165; p \&lt; 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p \&lt; 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

@article{elixhauser_comorbidity_1998,
  abstract = {Objectives. This study attempts to develop a comprehensive set of comorbidity measures for use with large administrative inpatient datasets., Methods. The study involved clinical and empirical review of comorbidity measures, development of a framework that attempts to segregate comorbidities from other aspects of the patient's condition, development of a comorbidity algorithm, and testing on heterogeneous and homogeneous patient groups. Data were drawn from all adult, nonmaternal inpatients from 438 acute care hospitals in California in 1992 (n = 1,779,167). Outcome measures were those commonly available in administrative data: length of stay, hospital charges, and in-hospital death., Results. A comprehensive set of 30 comorbidity measures was developed. The comorbidities were associated with substantial increases in length of stay, hospital charges, and mortality both for heterogeneous and homogeneous disease groups. Several comorbidities are described that are important predictors of outcomes, yet commonly are not measured. These include mental disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, obesity, coagulopathy, weight loss, and fluid and electrolyte disorders., Conclusions. The comorbidities had independent effects on outcomes and probably should not be simplified as an index because they affect outcomes differently among different patient groups. The present method addresses some of the limitations of previous measures. It is based on a comprehensive approach to identifying comorbidities and separates them from the primary reason for hospitalization, resulting in an expanded set of comorbidities that easily is applied without further refinement to administrative data for a wide range of diseases., (C) Lippincott-Raven Publishers},

@article{frank_risk-adjusted_2014,
  abstract = {Background

Although clinical outcomes have been reported for patients who do not accept allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT), many previous studies lack a control group, fail to use risk adjustment, and focus exclusively on cardiac surgery.

Study Design and Methods

We report a risk-adjusted, propensity score\textendash{}matched, retrospective case-control study of clinical outcomes for inpatients who did not accept ABT (bloodless, n\,=\,294) and those who did accept ABT (control, n\,=\,1157). Multidisciplinary specialized care was rendered to the bloodless patients to conserve blood and optimize clinical outcomes. Differences in hemoglobin (Hb), mortality, five morbid outcomes, and hospital charges and costs were compared. Subgroups of medical and surgical patients were analyzed, and independent predictors of outcome were determined by multivariate analysis.

Results

Overall, mortality was lower in the bloodless group (0.7\%) than in the control group (2.7\%; p\,=\,0.046), primarily attributed to the surgical subgroup. After risk adjustment, bloodless care was not an independent predictor of the composite adverse outcome (death or any morbid event; p\,=\,0.91; odds ratio, 1.02; 95\% confidence interval, 0.68-1.53). Discharge Hb concentrations were similar in the bloodless (10.8\,$\pm$\,2.7\,g/dL) and control (10.9\,$\pm$\,2.3\,g/dL) groups (p\,=\,0.42). Total and direct hospital costs were 12\% (p\,=\,0.02) and 18\% (p\,=\,0.02) less, respectively, in the bloodless patients, a difference attributed to the surgical subgroup.

Conclusions
Using appropriate blood conservation measures for patients who do not accept ABT results in similar or better outcomes and is associated with equivalent or lower costs. This specialized care may be beneficial even for those patients who accept ABT.},

  abstract = {Generic programming has recently emerged as a paradigm for developing highly reusable software libraries, most notably in C++. We have designed and implemented a constrained generics extension for C++ to support modular type checking of generic algorithms and to address other issues associated with unconstrained generics. To be as broadly applicable as possible, generic algorithms are defined with minimal requirements on their inputs. At the same time, to achieve a high degree of efficiency, generic algorithms may have multiple implementations that exploit features of specific classes of inputs. This process of algorithm specialization relies on non-local type information and conflicts directly with the local nature of modular type checking. In this paper, we review the design and implementation of our extensions for generic programming in C++, describe the issues of algorithm specialization and modular type checking in detail, and discuss the important design tradeoffs in trying to accomplish both.We present the particular design that we chose for our implementation, with the goal of hitting the sweet spot in this interesting design space.},

  abstract = {ContextA predictive model of mortality in heart failure may be useful for clinicians to improve communication with and care of hospitalized patients.ObjectivesTo identify predictors of mortality and to develop and to validate a model using information available at hospital presentation.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective study of 4031 community-based patients presenting with heart failure at multiple hospitals in Ontario, Canada (2624 patients in the derivation cohort from 1999-2001 and 1407 patients in the validation cohort from 1997-1999), who had been identitifed as part of the Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment (EFFECT) study.Main Outcome MeasuresAll-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality.ResultsThe mortality rates for the derivation cohort and validation cohort, respectively, were 8.9\% and 8.2\% in hospital, 10.7\% and 10.4\% at 30 days, and 32.9\% and 30.5\% at 1 year. Multivariable predictors of mortality at both 30 days and 1 year included older age, lower systolic blood pressure, higher respiratory rate, higher urea nitrogen level (all P\&lt;.001), and hyponatremia (P\&lt;.01). Comorbid conditions associated with mortality included cerebrovascular disease (30-day mortality odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.98; P = .03), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.66; 95\% CI, 1.22-2.27; P = .002), hepatic cirrhosis (OR, 3.22; 95\% CI, 1.08-9.65; P = .04), dementia (OR, 2.54; 95\% CI, 1.77-3.65; P\&lt;.001), and cancer (OR, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.28-2.70; P = .001). A risk index stratified the risk of death and identified low- and high-risk individuals. Patients with very low-risk scores ($\leq$60) had a mortality rate of 0.4\% at 30 days and 7.8\% at 1 year. Patients with very high-risk scores (\&gt;150) had a mortality rate of 59.0\% at 30 days and 78.8\% at 1 year. Patients with higher 1-year risk scores had reduced survival at all times up to 1 year (log-rank, P\&lt;.001). For the derivation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 0.80 for 30-day mortality and 0.77 for 1-year mortality. Predicted mortality rates in the validation cohort closely matched observed rates across the entire spectrum of risk.ConclusionsAmong community-based heart failure patients, factors identifiable within hours of hospital presentation predicted mortality risk at 30 days and 1 year. The externally validated predictive index may assist clinicians in estimating heart failure mortality risk and in providing quantitative guidance for decision making in heart failure care.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding system presents challenges for using administrative data. Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop ICD-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms. Methods: ICD-10 coding algorithms were developed by "translation" of the ICD-9-CM codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physicians' assessment of the face-validity of selected ICD-10 codes. The process of carefully developing ICD-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original ICD-9-CM algorithms, the enhanced ICD-9-CM algorithms, and the new ICD-10 coding algorithms. Results: Among 56,585 patients in the ICD-9-CM data and 58,805 patients in the ICD-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new ICD-10 and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.860 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.870 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm. Conclusions: These newly developed ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM comorbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing ICD-9-CM coding algorithms.},

  abstract = {With advances in the effectiveness of treatment and disease management, the contribution of chronic comorbid diseases (comorbidities) found within the Charlson comorbidity index to mortality is likely to have changed since development of the index in 1984. The authors reevaluated the Charlson index and reassigned weights to each condition by identifying and following patients to observe mortality within 1 year after hospital discharge. They applied the updated index and weights to hospital discharge data from 6 countries and tested for their ability to predict in-hospital mortality. Compared with the original Charlson weights, weights generated from the Calgary, Alberta, Canada, data (2004) were 0 for 5 comorbidities, decreased for 3 comorbidities, increased for 4 comorbidities, and did not change for 5 comorbidities. The C statistics for discriminating in-hospital mortality between the new score generated from the 12 comorbidities and the Charlson score were 0.825 (new) and 0.808 (old), respectively, in Australian data (2008), 0.828 and 0.825 in Canadian data (2008), 0.878 and 0.882 in French data (2004), 0.727 and 0.723 in Japanese data (2008), 0.831 and 0.836 in New Zealand data (2008), and 0.869 and 0.876 in Swiss data (2008).

@article{So_ICD10codingalgorithms_2006,
  abstract = {Background
With the introduction of ICD-10 throughout Canada, it is important to ensure that Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) comorbidities employed in risk adjustment methods remain valid and robust. Therefore, we developed ICD-10 coding algorithms for nine AMI comorbidities, examined the validity of the ICD-10 and ICD-9 coding algorithms in detection of these comorbidities, and assessed their performance in predicting mortality. The nine comorbidities that we examined were shock, diabetes with complications, congestive heart failure, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, and cardiac dysrhythmias.

Methods
Coders generated a comprehensive list of ICD-10 codes corresponding to each AMI comorbidity. Physicians independently reviewed and determined the clinical relevance of each item on the list. To ensure that the newly developed ICD-10 coding algorithms were valid in recording comorbidities, medical charts were reviewed. After assessing ICD-10 algorithms' validity, both ICD-10 and ICD-9 algorithms were applied to a Canadian provincial hospital discharge database to predict in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality.

Results
Compared to chart review data as a 'criterion standard', ICD-9 and ICD-10 data had similar sensitivities (ranging from 7.1 \textendash{} 100\%), and specificities (above 93.6\%) for each of the nine AMI comorbidities studied. The frequencies for the comorbidities were similar between ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding algorithms for 49,861 AMI patients in a Canadian province during 1994 \textendash{} 2004. The C-statistics for predicting 30-day and 1 year mortality were the same for ICD-9 (0.82) and for ICD-10 data (0.81).

Conclusion
The ICD-10 coding algorithms developed in this study to define AMI comorbidities performed similarly as past ICD-9 coding algorithms in detecting conditions and risk-adjustment in our sample. However, the ICD-10 coding algorithms should be further validated in external databases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comorbidity measures are necessary to describe patient populations and adjust for confounding. In direct comparisons, studies have found the Elixhauser comorbidity system to be statistically slightly superior to the Charlson comorbidity system at adjusting for comorbidity. However, the Elixhauser classification system requires 30 binary variables, making its use for reporting and analysis of comorbidity cumbersome.
OBJECTIVE: Modify the Elixhauser classification system into a single numeric score for administrative data.
METHODS: For all hospitalizations at the Ottawa Hospital, Canada, between 1996 and 2008, we determined if International Classification of Disease codes for chronic diagnoses were in any of the 30 Elixhauser comorbidity groups. We then used backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression to determine the independent association of each comorbidity group with death in hospital. Regression coefficients were modified into a scoring system that reflected the strength of each comorbidity group's independent association with hospital death.
RESULTS: Hospitalizations that were included were 345,795 (derivation: 228,565; validation 117,230). Twenty-one of the 30 groups were independently associated with hospital mortality. The resulting comorbidity score had an equivalent discrimination in the derivation and validation groups (overall c-statistic 0.763, 95\% CI: 0.759-0.766). This was similar to models having all Elixhauser groups (0.760, 95\% CI: 0.756-0.764) or significant groups only (0.759, 95\% CI: 0.754-0.762), but significantly exceeded discrimination when comorbidity was expressed using the Charlson score (0.745, 95\% CI: 0.742-0.749).
CONCLUSION: When analyzing administrative data, the Elixhauser comorbidity system can be condensed to a single numeric score that summarizes disease burden and is adequately discriminative for death in hospital.},
